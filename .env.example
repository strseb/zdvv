# ZDVV Proxy Configuration Example
# This file serves as an example for the .env file.
# Copy this to .env and fill in your actual configuration values.

# General Proxy Settings
# Set to true to disable JWT authentication and potentially run HTTP instead of HTTPS (if certs are not provided).
# Useful for local development or trusted environments.
ZDVV_INSECURE=false

# Control Server Settings (Optional)
# URL of the ZDVV Control Server
# ZDVV_CONTROL_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8081
# Shared secret for authenticating with the Control Server
# ZDVV_CONTROL_SERVER_SHARED_SECRET=your-very-secret-key

# Server Configuration
# HTTPS Configuration
# Address for the HTTPS listener (e.g., :443, :8443)
ZDVV_HTTPS_ADDR=":8443"

# Path to the TLS certificate file (e.g., server.crt).
# If not provided and ZDVV_HTTPS_HOSTNAME is set, Let's Encrypt will be attempted.
ZDVV_HTTPS_CERT_FILE="server.crt"

# Path to the TLS key file (e.g., server.key).
# If not provided and ZDVV_HTTPS_HOSTNAME is set, Let's Encrypt will be attempted.
ZDVV_HTTPS_KEY_FILE="server.key"

# Hostname for TLS certificate generation (e.g., for Let's Encrypt).
# If you provide CertFile and KeyFile, this can be omitted or used for SNI.
# ZDVV_HTTPS_HOSTNAME=your.proxy.domain.com

# HTTP/HTTPS Protocol Settings
# Enable HTTPS/1.1 support (true/false)
ZDVV_HTTPS_V1_ENABLED=true
# Enable HTTPS/2 support (true/false)
ZDVV_HTTPS_V2_ENABLED=true
# Enable HTTPS/3 (QUIC) support (true/false)
# Note: HTTPS/3 requires UDP and proper certificate setup.
ZDVV_HTTPS_V3_ENABLED=true

# Plain HTTP Configuration (Optional)
# Enable the plain HTTP listener
ZDVV_HTTP_ENABLED=false
# Address for the plain HTTP listener (e.g., :80, :8080)
ZDVV_HTTP_ADDR=":8080"

# CORS Allowed Origins
# Comma-separated list of allowed origins for CORS requests (e.g., http://localhost:3000,https://example.com).
# Use '*' to allow all origins (be cautious with this in production).
